# TermDocs
interactive terminal markdown-documentation viewer with support for images and with code-highlighting.

## Getting Started

go to the [online documentation](https://playerg9.github.io/TermDocs/) and follow the steps in the `getting-started` section.
Afterward you can start TermDocs with `termdocs [docs-folder]` and optionally press `F1` for a preview of what TermDocs can do.
